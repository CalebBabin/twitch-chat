# twitch-chat-emotes
Connects to twitch chat and emits emotes as they're typed in twitch chat.

If you're looking for a library to interact with twitch chat, you should look into [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js), which this library is based off of.

This is specifically a library created for projects that run in the browser and require BTTV GIF emote support for Canvas and WebGL instances.
